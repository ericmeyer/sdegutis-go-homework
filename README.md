## Installing Go

On Mac, run `brew install go --use-git`. Other package managers should work similarly.

If your package manager doesn't have Go, it can be installed via [these directions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).

## Installing GoBDD (required)

Clone it from [this github repo](https://github.com/sdegutis/gobdd) and inside the directory, run `make test install`

## Running tests

At the root level, type `gomake` to run all the test.
